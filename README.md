# FileHoarderFiesta 

Boy, oh boy, do I love the MacOS Screenshot tool... I probably hit `Shift+Cmd+4` like 25 times a day but it sure can get messy. This is a simple utility tool written in C++ that deals with this problem. Once you clone this repo and compile the source file, you just run the executable and answer a few questions. After that, it will quickly clean up your images and put them into a nice `images/` directory inside of the FileHoarderFiesta directory and if you leave it running, it will check every 10 minutes, making sure you don't accumulate too many images on your Desktop. It can also play either a normal or funny sound every time it moves an image.

I bet I could have written this in a quarter of the time with Python, but C++ looks a lot cooler.
